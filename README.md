# Binary Search through sorted list
Given a number and a list/array of integers that you know is sorted in ascending order, find the index of the number in the list (or -1 if the number does not occur in the list).

So for the given sorted array [1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 23, 66, 67, 68] and number 12, return 6.
If the array is the same, but the number is 65, return -1.

=======================================================

* Goal: Index of Number. If found. Or -1 if not.
* BinarySearch: To Do.
* Given: Array Is Sorted.
* Assumptions: length of array needs to be given
